## 🏗 How to Install

- **\*nix**

```sh
if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beriholic/nvimdots/main/scripts/install.sh)"
else
    bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beriholic/nvimdots/main/scripts/install.sh)"
fi
```

It's strongly recommended to read [Wiki: Prerequisites](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots/wiki/Prerequisites) before starting, especially for \*nix users.
